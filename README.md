[![Deploy to Salesforce](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afawcett/githubsfdeploy/master/src/main/webapp/resources/img/deploy.png)](https://githubsfdeploy.herokuapp.com?owner=Kaptio&repo=responsive-html-email-templates)

HTML emails often get neglected. **Styling HTML email is painful**. Tables, inline CSS, unsupported CSS, desktop clients, web clients, mobile clients, various devices, various providers.

Weâ€™ve tried to remove some of the pain with a really simple responsivle html email template starter kit.

## What's included
* List components..

## How to use
* List examples..

## Inline the CSS

Before sending HTML emails **you should inline your CSS**.

We recommend using [Premailer](http://premailer.dialect.ca/) to accomplish this.

Our repo contains both the original templates with a separate CSS stylesheet, as well as templates with CSS already inlined for you to preview. See the `/templates/inlined` folder.
