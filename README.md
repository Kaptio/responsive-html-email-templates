HTML emails often get neglected. **Styling HTML email is painful**. Tables, inline CSS, unsupported CSS, desktop clients, web clients, mobile clients, various devices, various providers.

Weâ€™ve tried to remove some of the pain with a really simple responsivle html email template starter kit.

## What's included
* KaptioTravelEmailTemplate - Standard template for all emails
* Alert_Email_Template - Standard template for sending alerts via email
* SGTCo_Action - Standard template for email requiring an action from the recipient
* SGTCo_Billing_Template - Standard template for sending and invoice vie email

## Setup Guide
* Click the 'Deploy to Salesforce' button in the first section
* Log into the salesforce org you wish to deploy the templates on
* when you get to the next screen, click the 'deploy' button on the top right of the screen

## Inline the CSS
Before sending HTML emails **you should inline your CSS**.
We recommend using [Premailer](http://premailer.dialect.ca/) to accomplish this.
